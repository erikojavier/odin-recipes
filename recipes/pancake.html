            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener, (60g | 2 oz)</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups milk, (440 ml)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, (60g | 2 oz)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), 
                baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. 
                Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, 
                vanilla and egg.</li>
            <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly 
                folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth 
                (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).</li>
            <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. 
                Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
            <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, 
                flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>    
        </ol>
