    <h2>Pan Sobao</h2>
        <p>Puerto Rican pan sobao is a pillowy-soft, chewy, and semi-sweet bread with a soft crust, and it's utterly delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup (170 milliliters) warm water (105 F to 115 F)</li>
            <li>1 (0.25-ounce) packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (25 grams) lard, or vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (300 grams) bread flour, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon (4 grams) kosher salt</li>
            <li>Cooking spray, for greasing bowl</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, 
                add the warm water and stir in the yeast
                 and sugar until completely dissolved.
                 Let it stand for 15 minutes to allow the yeast to bloom.</li>
            <li>Mix in the lard, or shortening, 
                then about 1 cup of bread flour and the kosher salt. 
                Add more bread flour—about 1/4 cup at a time—until
                the dough begins to follow mixing spoon around the bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board.
                Knead for 10 minutes, adding bread flour in small amounts
                 as needed when it becomes sticky. 
                 (You may not use all of the flour.) The dough 
                 should be elastic and smooth.</li>
            <li>Place the ball of dough in a lightly greased bowl
                and flip it over so both sides are greased. Cover 
                with a lint-free kitchen towel and let rise for 45 minutes,
                 or until double in size.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough. Turn it out onto a very 
                lightly floured board and form it into a ball.
                Cover and let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently knead the dough for about 1 minute, 
                dusting it lightly with flour as needed to prevent sticking. 
                Form the dough into a ball, cover with a towel
                 and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough back and forth under your palms to shape
                 the ball into a long baguette, about 12 inches long. 
                 As you roll, work from the middle to the ends 
                 so the loaf is a relatively even thickness.</li>
            <li>Place the loaf on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. 
                Cover with a towel, and let rise for 30 minutes, 
                or until double in size.</li>
            <li>Let the bread rest for a few minutes on the baking sheet, 
                then transfer to a baking rack to cool completely before 
                slicing.</li>
        </ol>
